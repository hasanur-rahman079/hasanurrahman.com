summary: Uploading Image or File to Aws S3 Bucket.

In this guide, we will walk through the process of uploading an image or file to an AWS S3 bucket. Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a widely used object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with S3 bucket created.
- AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key with S3 permissions.
- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Step 1: Install the AWS SDK

To interact with AWS S3 using Node.js, we need to install the AWS SDK. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

or just install s3 client

```bash
npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

## Step 2: Set Up AWS S3 Credentials

Create a file named `utils/s3_config.js` in the root of your project and add your AWS S3 credentials:

```js title="s3_config.js"
const bucketName = process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME;
const bucketRegion = process.env.S3_BUCKET_REGION;
const accessKeyId = process.env.S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID;
const secretAccessKey = process.env.S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY;
```

Replace S3_BUCKET_NAME, S3_BUCKET_REGION, S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID and S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with your actual s3 credentials.

## Step 3: Create an S3 Upload Function

Now, create a JavaScript file (e.g., s3_upload.js) with the following content:

First we need to configure s3 client-

```js title="s3_config.js"
const s3 = new S3Client({
credentials: {
        accessKeyId: accessKeyId,
        secretAccessKey: secretAccessKey,
    },
    region: bucketRegion,
});
```

Then we need to configure multer to process the multipart/form-data from client side. To do that first create another file `multer_config.js` to the utils folder then add the following content-

```js title="multer_config.js"

const multer = require("multer");

const storage = multer.memoryStorage(); // Use memory storage to store the file buffer

// file filter
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (file.mimetype === "image/jpeg" || file.mimetype === "image/png") {
    cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error("Invalid Mime Type, only JPEG and PNG"), false);
  }
};

// upload handler
exports.uploadeFileHandler = multer({
  storage: storage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
});
```

Now we can use this multer config to upload file to s3 bucket. To do that first import the multer and s3 config file to a new middleware file `controller/uploadController.js`-

```js title="controller/uploadController.js"

const { DataModel } = require("../db/model/data.model");
const { PutObjectCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");
const sharp = require("sharp");
const {
  bucketName,
  randomFileName,
  s3,
} = require("../utils/s3_config");


// Create a handler to upload file to s3 bucket and save the file name and body data to database
const uploadeFile = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    console.log("req.file", req.file);
    console.log("req.body received by server", req.body);

    req.file.buffer;

    //resize image
    const buffer = await sharp(req.file.buffer)
      .resize({ height: 1920, width: 1080, fit: "contain" })
      .toBuffer();

    const imageName = randomFileName() + imageFile.originalname;
    const imageFile = req.file;

    //   upload only image to s3
    const params = {
      Bucket: bucketName,
      Key: imageName,
      Body: buffer,
      ContentType: imageFile.mimetype,
    };

    const command = new PutObjectCommand(params);

    // send to s3
    await s3.send(command);

    // to add the image url extract data from the body
    const { image, title } = req.body;

    // create a new collection object with the data
    const exhibitionData = {
      title,
      picture: imageName,
    };

    const exhibition = await DataModel.create(exhibitionData);
    res.status(200).json({ message: "success" });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

## Step 4: add the middleware to the route

```js title="routes/upload.js"
router.post("/image", uploadeFileHandler.single("image"), uploadeFile);
```

This will upload the specified image/file to your AWS S3 bucket.

Congratulations! You've successfully uploaded an image/file to an AWS S3 bucket using Node.js.This will upload the specified image/file to your AWS S3 bucket.
